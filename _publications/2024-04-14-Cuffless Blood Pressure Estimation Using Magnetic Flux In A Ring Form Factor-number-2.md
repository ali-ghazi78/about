Smart rings represent a promising frontier in wearables for
pervasive physiological health monitoring. They offer
convenient and unobtrusive wear and reliable and firm
contact with the finger for higher sensing fidelity. However,
their use for monitoring complex physiological parameters
with clinical use-cases, such as blood pressure (BP), still
remains a challenge. While existing approaches including
optical (e.g., PPG) and electrical (e.g., bio-impedance)
modalities offer great promise, the direction to measure small
mechanical movements of the skin due to blood volumetric
changes and convert this to BP provides an exciting and
complementary direction. Our Hall effect ring sensor can
capture variations in magnetic flux due to the underlying
pulsatile activity at digital arteries. We provide an end-to-end
analysis to assess the performance of our smart rings in
estimating BP. Our results indicate that we achieved a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 4.79 mmHg and 2.61 mmHg for
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively,
demonstrating the potential of this innovative design for
clinical applications.
